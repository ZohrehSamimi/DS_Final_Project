# Moshaâ€™ereh Dialogue-Based Game ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ¤

## Overview
The **Moshaâ€™ereh Dialogue-Based Game** is an interactive voice-only application inspired by the traditional Persian poetry game, **Moshaâ€™ereh**. It uses **Speechstate** for voice recognition and dialogue management, allowing players to engage in poetic battles using authentic Persian poetry.

## Game Concept
**Moshaâ€™ereh** is a turn-based Persian poetry game where players recite verses starting with the last letter of the previous verse. The game continues until a player fails to provide a valid verse within the time limit.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition:** Powered by **Speechstate** for an immersive voice-based experience.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Alternate turns between the player and the system.
- **Authenticity Check:** Validates verses using a database of authentic Persian poetry.
- **No Repeats:** Ensures that no verse is repeated within the same game session.
- **Time Limit:** Keeps the gameplay dynamic with timed turns.

## Technology Stack
- **TypeScript** - For maintainable and scalable code.
- **Speechstate** - For dialogue management and voice recognition.
- **Node.js** - Runtime for executing the game logic.
- **Hazm** or **Parsivar** - Farsi text processing and tokenization.
- **SQLite** - Database for storing and retrieving Persian poetry.
